# app

Built from an instance of a project generated by yeoman angular generator this seed has all the bits I want and follows a component based structure, viz:
* assets: app/assets/{css,img,..}
* code: 
  * app definition: app/app/app.module.js
  * UI router states: app/app/app.states.js
  * app configuration: app/app/configuration.js
  * components: app/app/components
  * services: app/app/services
  * filters: app/app/filters
  * test data: app/app/test-data
  * boilerplate / example code (controllers, directives, services, filters and spec files): app/app/examples

## Setup
`npm install && bower install`

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `karma start test/karma.conf` and then connect a browser by connecting to http://($host):8080. Karma is configured with `karma-ng-html2js-preprocessor` so that all templates are compiled into the template cache and accesible from there in the test specs. See app/app/examples/directive.spec.js.

### Coverage reports

The karma coverage plugin will generate coverage reports in a folder `coverage` at the root of the project. Start a webserver in that folder to view the HTML reports (`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 2000`).
